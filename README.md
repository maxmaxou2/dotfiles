# Dotfiles

Here are my dotfiles, I will be adding to it and explaining along the way.

A journey begins.

## Setup/

### HomeBrew related
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
ln -s ~/dotfiles/.Brewfile ~/.Brewfile
brew bundle --global
```

### Symlinks
```
stow conda hammerspoon karabiner nvim pdb rich ssh tmux zsh
```

### Additional steps

- Karabiner :
    - Open Karabiner-Elements from your Applications folder.
    - Grant necessary permissions in System Preferences > Security & Privacy (Input Monitoring and Accessibility). 

- Postgres related :
```
createuser --superuser $USER -U postgres
createdb $USER -U $USER
```


## Todo List/

- Add scripts calling general commands for setup

## Hammerspoon Configuration/

My Hammerspoon setup includes several productivity-enhancing features:

### Key Logger
- Displays active key presses in real-time
- Toggle with `ctrl + cmd + k`
- Useful for presentations and debugging keyboard inputs
- Cycles through predefined positions before disabling

### Application Quick Launch
- Fast application switching using keyboard shortcuts
- Mapped to `ctrl + cmd + [number]`
- Common applications mapped to numbers (7,8,9, etc.)
- Provides instant access to frequently used applications
- Application window maximization (fake fullscreen) using ctrl + cmd + F

### Multi-Display Management
- Intelligent window management for multiple displays
- Automatically saves window positions when disconnecting external monitors
- Restores window layouts when reconnecting displays
- Screen swapping functionality with `ctrl + cmd + m`
- Maintains application workspace consistency across different display configurations

This setup ensures a smooth workflow when transitioning between single and multi-monitor setups while providing quick access to applications and keyboard input visualization when needed.
